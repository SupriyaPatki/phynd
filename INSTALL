Phynd Documentation
=====================================================
Written by David Borgeson <borgeson@engr.uconn.edu>
Edited by Brent Holden <brent@engr.uconn.edu>




NOTICE: This is not compatible with Phynd 5.0.x.  It is close, but the database structure has changed, and therefore the old database structure is not supported.

However, things have only gotten better and faster.




REQUIRED PROGRAMS
=====================================================

Perl 5.8.0	With Modules: Thread, DBD, DBI
Apache	mod_PHP
PHP 4.3.x
MySQL
fastping (included)
SAMBA (smbclient)

RECOMMENDED PROGRAMS:
=====================================================

phpMyAdmin






QUICK INSTALL PROCEDURE
=====================================================

* Install all the necessary software.
* Import the database "phynd.sql" into your system.
* Edit the /etc/phynd/ configuration files to suit your needs. Make sure it is readable by the users running all the files.
* Update the MySQL information to reflect the changes you made (username).
* Alias the directories /config and /www in your Apache configuration so they are accessible from the web.
* Go to your site config (ex: http://mysite.com/config/) and add the necessary IP addresses.
* Run the "Build XXX list" from the config site.
* Run the catalog.pl script.
* On the first run, it will generate a few errors.  This is a result of the database being empty. Don't worry, everything worked OK.
* Search search search!!!!


Please read on for details......











DETAILED INSTALL PROCEDURE
=====================================================


/catalog - catalog script
/www - the web frontend for searching
/config - web based config files
/etc - this directory should go in your root /etc directory

The /etc/phynd/ directory contains files named phyndvars.php and phyndvars.pl.  They are the global variables for all the files.  The .php file has <? ?>  tags because it is included in the php files.  Otherwise, the files are exactly the same.


Install all the required programs.

* 	Create a local user for accessing the MySQL database. This can be anything, but you will need
	to change the variables in the /etc/phynd directory.  By default this is set to phynd/phynd.

* 	Import the initial database structure into MySQL: mysql -u root -p < phynd.sql

* 	Using phpMyAdmin, or editing MySQL manually, edit the permissions of the phynd database, 
	giving access only to the local user you set (root should by default have access 
	anyhow).  The user who accesses the database should have permissions to do everything 
	but GRANT other permissions. Basically, give the user SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE, 
	ALTER, INDEX, DROP.
	
	NOTE: You can do the previous step manually using the mysql client, however this can be 
	tricky, and it is much easier to do with phpMyAdmin.

*	For extra security, the permissions should only be allowed on user@localhost, so nobody 
	outside the physical computer can mess with the data.  If you want others to be able to 
	access the raw data, we recommend creating a special user, or allowing all users to only 
	SELECT.


For the next section, refer to the phynd.conf provided.  This can be included in your apache configuration.


*	Alias a directory for the configuration files (in the /config directory) in your Apache
	configuration.  We recommend using an .htaccess file to control access to the 
	configuration files.  It is also possible to control access by using the Order deny, 
	allow and Allow from x.x.x.x Apache configuration options.  Either way, you simply want 
	to bar anybody from just changing the configuration.  If you don't like our 
	configuration manager, simply edit the databases manually, or use phpMyAdmin to do 
	configuration.

*	Alias a directory for the web frontend search pages (examples in /www. This is a directory 
	where you must be extremely careful.  We recommend allowing access to this directory 
	only from local network subnets that will be using Phynd. We do not recommend allowing 
	the whole world to access this directory for security reasons.  If you want to allow 
	everyone to see the search page, there are extra measures to ensure that no unauthorized 
	users are accessing Phynd.


All the web-based files are given as examples, but since this is open sourced, obviously, you 
can edit them however you see fit. We are merely providing a framework.



CONFIGURATION
=====================================================

Point your web browser to the location where you put your configuration files.

Ex: http://yoursite.com/config/

Catalog Configuration - decides what hosts will be cataloged
	Netblocks -the netblocks that the spider will search, these are inclusive at the ends
	Include IP's - any IP's you want to be cataloged, that are outside the netblocks
	Exclude IP's - any IP's you want to exclude from being cataloged
	Restrict Words - do not catalog any files that contain these words, they are wildcard at the beginning and end, so 'ron' will filter out anything that matches *ron*

	Build catalog Iplist - creates the list of IP's to catalog. This must be done each time you edit any of the categories



NOTE: The Access Configuration is an exclusive list. If an IP is not listed, it will not be given access.

Access Configuration -decides which hosts are allowed to search the Phynd database
	Netblocks - netblocks that are allowed to search
	Include IP's - any IP's outside the netblocks that are allowed to search
	Exclude IP's - any IP's outside the netblocks that are not allowed to search

	Build access Iplist - creates the list of IP's to allow access. This must be done each time you edit any of the categories


*	Edit the phyndvars.inc file in the /catalog directory, and make it reflect the number of 
	threads you wish to run on your system.  We found that 14 threads saturates a 512MB 
	system, and 18+ just doesn't work.  You may want to run the catalog manually while you 
	tweak this setting...If you get segmentation faults, lower the number of threads.

	To have the catalog script run automatically, place an entry in your crontab 
	(/path/to/catalog.pl).  We recommend having it run every 6 hours. You can always run the 
	catalog script manually in case there is a need for debugging.  The script takes care of 
	updating the database, so you don't need to do anything beyond running it.

*	Using the example web frontend, you can make your own custom page for searching.  We only 
	provided a skeleton for reference.  It is recommended that you run the function that 
	checks Access Privileges before displaying search results - the example page does this.

*	Sample config files for Apache and crontab have been provided in the /etc/phynd 
	directory.  Edit the phynd.conf to your liking and include it in your 
	/etc/apache/httpd.conf configuration at the end.

Once you have done all this, you are ready to allow people to search Phynd.

You may want to tweak MySQL to your needs, as some systems react better to different settings.  
If you experience heavy load (3+ searches/sec), it is probably a good idea to increase the 
amount of open tables, pointer memory....etc.


The categories that are generated in the database, and also on the search page are in the MySQL database.  They can be edited...and you'll figure out the format.

Run the catalog.pl script, either by crontab or manually, to fill the database.





Good Luck!!!!
