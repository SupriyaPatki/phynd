Description
========================================================

The Phynd Network Indexer is a Windows Networking cataloging agent that queries a list of 
configurable IP addresses to find Windows (Samba) shares and catalogs their contents into a 
searchable MySQL database.  This database can be searched through a world wide web 
interface.


How To Install 
========================================================

The notes on how to install Phynd are located in the INSTALL document. The INSTALL document will 
go over a brief description of how to extract the Phynd tarball and how to get the catalog agent 
up and running.  The INSTALL document does NOT go over how to install CPAN modules, how to 
configure the Apache webserver, or how to configure MySQL.  These software packages are assumed 
to be installed and correctly configured before Phynd is ever installed.


Notes
========================================================

This program does not provide a listing of any hidden shares within your network.  The Phynd 
indexer respects the privacy of those not wishing to make their shares public.  Any publicly 
shared host containing files that is configured to be cataloged will be cataloged, with the 
forementioned exception.

The authors and people involved with this project take no responsibility for any 
irresponsibility, negligence, or misuse on the part of the end user using this software, nor 
the person providing this software for public or private use.  This software is provided with an 
interface to remove violating keywords from a search listing, and is intended to be used by 
sites in correspondence with the DMCA "Safe Harbour" provisions if it is deemed necessary to 
remove any search listings.

Any violations incurred by the end user of this software is of their own will, and their 
responsibility.
